- go to styled-components.com and your choice to use it
- OR go inline style using two curly braces and camelCase, see it in the Header
- Or use internal style, see it in the Header

- We are NOT using inline or internal style, so
  - Delete App.css and logo.svg
  - Update index.css with our own style, and make sure in include the following in the index.js
    - import './index.css';
